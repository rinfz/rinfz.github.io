From Rob. Just writing this here so that I don't forget it. For a while I have wondered whether I am missing something when it comes to tea-making. Coffee is more straightforward, I feel. Tea is way more subtle, and perhaps less is more (as opposed to my brute-force put a ton of tea in and steep for 5+ mins like a normal teabag). So lets see if this is worth it.

Rob says: "The second brew is the best tasting."

There is a guide here: https://teahousesantafe.com/blogs/news-resources/your-guide-to-gongfu-brewing

In short:

1. Preheat jug with boiling water and pour it out.
2. ~4g/100ml of tea, just enough water to cover it and instantly pour out the liquid (washing the tea).
3. 100ml water in and steep based on the guide.
4. Add extra time for each resteep (additional infusion).

Apparently there's no real maximum between steeps but its best to wait at least a minute or two (so 5 mins ish to actually drink the tea is probably fine).

Essential: strainer

Optional: Temperature controlled kettle
